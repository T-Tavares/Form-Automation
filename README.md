### FORM-AUTOMATION ###

I wrote this simple automation node JS script to help me request house viewings dates and blueprints when I was house hunting. All the variables and CSS selectors/paths are for the (https://www.realestate.co.nz/) website.

This script was my first attempt at automation, where I have not followed any tutorial. And although it's simple, it was a good exercise for me in researching documentation and building my ideas from scratch.

For this project to work you will need Selenium web-driver installed.
More about it here https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/

I used Firefox webdriver but any webdriver you choose shouldn't make any difference for this project.
